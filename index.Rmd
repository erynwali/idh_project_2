## Title 


## Introduction + Research Question 


## Research Hypothesis 
> There is a statistical difference in the way gender and themes are portrayed when female authors who write under male pseudonyms are compared with their female and male author counterparts.


## Corpus Description 
We created a corpus where we picked an equal number of works by three categories of authors. The corpus wasnâ€™t exhaustive; it was manually curated making subjective judgments. We chose 4 books each from female authors who wrote under male pseudonyms, female authors, and male authors. As we were focusing on finding the counterparts of pen name authors, we chose counterparts who wrote in the same century as them or even whose work was compared with them. The works we selected by each author were their most famous works present on Gutenberg.
